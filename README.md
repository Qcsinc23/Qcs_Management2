# QCS Management Application

## Architectural Overview

This project implements comprehensive architectural improvements based on a detailed review, focusing on best practices in modern web application development.

### 1. Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration enforced
- Eliminated implicit `any` types
- Enhanced type checking across the application

### 2. Error Handling
- Centralized global error boundary
- Comprehensive error logging
- Improved user error feedback mechanism

### 3. Logging
- Centralized `LoggingService`
- Configurable log levels
- Production-ready logging abstraction
- Supports encryption and context tracking

### 4. Security
- Secure storage service with encryption
- Token-based authentication middleware
- Role-based access control
- Enhanced client-side security practices

### 5. Performance
- Advanced ESLint configuration
- Code quality and complexity checks
- Performance-oriented scripts and tooling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.0.0+
- npm 10.0.0+
- Clerk Account (for authentication)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Set up Clerk Authentication:
   - Create an account at [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
   - Create a new application in the Clerk dashboard
   - Copy the Publishable Key
4. Configure Environment Variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Replace `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with your Clerk Publishable Key
5. Run `npm run dev`

### Environment Configuration
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Clerk authentication publishable key
- `NODE_ENV`: Development environment setting

## Development Workflow

### Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:strict`: Strict linting with zero warnings
- `npm run type-check`: TypeScript type checking
- `npm run test`: Run test suite
- `npm run security:audit`: Check dependency vulnerabilities

### Commit Hooks
- Pre-commit: Lint staged files
- Pre-push: Type checking and strict linting

## Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Strict engine requirements

## Contributing
1. Follow coding standards
2. Write tests for new features
3. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` before committing
4. Submit pull requests with clear descriptions

## Security
- Never commit sensitive information
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Report security issues via responsible disclosure

## Troubleshooting
### Authentication Issues
- Ensure Clerk Publishable Key is correctly set in `.env`
- Check Clerk dashboard for any configuration problems
- Verify network connectivity to Clerk services
